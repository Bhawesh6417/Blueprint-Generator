# **Blueprint Generator: Room Layout Visualization Tool**

## **Overview**

The **Blueprint Generator** is a desktop application developed using **Tkinter** and **Matplotlib**, designed to create and visualize customizable room layouts for houses. Users can input room specifications such as plot dimensions, room types, and additional features (garage, garden) to generate multiple layout variations. The generated blueprints are displayed in a visual format for easy viewing and comparison.

This application is perfect for real estate professionals, architects, or anyone interested in visualizing different house layouts.

- **Room Visualization:** Visual representation of rooms with color-coding for different room types (e.g., living room, kitchen, bedroom).
- **Navigation:** Use "Previous" and "Next" buttons to easily browse through generated layouts.
